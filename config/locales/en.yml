      paragraph_1:
        "There have been many changes to the volunteer program with comparison to previous years. The goal of
        the new program is for the volunteers to build their skills in either the Makerspace or Brunsfield
        by getting them to complete tasks generated by the space managers. These tasks will be available on
        Makerepo and the volunteers can sign up for them once they complete necessary training."
      paragraph_2:
        "First, the volunteers will have to complete two mandatory trainings, a 3D printing workshop and their
        basic training in the MTC. If they have done the training within the past year and have been actively
        using the spaces, they don’t need to repeat it. Once they have completed both of those, they will
        need to shadow for 6 hours in the Makerspace and 6 hours in Brunsfield."
      paragraph_3:
        "The goal of these shadowing shifts is to get the volunteers comfortable with the spaces by learning
        the vibes of the spaces and getting exposure to some of the other things that can be done. It’s
        important that volunteers hear some of the questions being asked by students to learn how to answer
        them and therefore learning more information about the spaces."
      paragraph_4:
        "Once the candidates have completed their trainings and shadowing, a staff member will accept
        them as a volunteer on Makerepo and they will gain access to the task list. The task list
        has various small project for the volunteers to accomplish on it with a suggested number of
        hours it will take to complete and then a corresponding amount of CC points they will get
        from completing the task. CC points are essentially translated into Makerstore gift cards.
        Students can use them to purchase things from the Makerstore or can use them to pay for
        their proficiency projects. Proficiency projects are the test project students can complete
        once they have completed a suggested number of hours building the skill of their choice and
        feel they are ready to move up to the next level.
        Upon successful completion of the proficiency project, they will receive a badge which will be
        visible on their Linkedin profile. They start at basic proficiency upon completing the workshop,
        and can move up all the way to Mastery."
      paragraph_5:
        "Volunteers will also have the opportunity to sign up for tasks on Makerepo such as “open hours
        in the Makerspace” and for specific events like Makercon. They can receive volunteer hours for
        doing these tasks."
      paragraph_6:
        "If people are interested in volunteering, tell them to reach out to me by email at
        and I will send them all the information they need. If there are
        previous volunteers, they still need to go through the required trainings and if they have
        questions about it tell them to email me and we can talk about their specific case. My goal is to
        have it as systematic as possible however there are always exceptions and I am going to do my
        best to accommodate within reason."
