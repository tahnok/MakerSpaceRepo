## New Developer Setup

You must have Git and Ruby 2.7.3 installed. See [the Ruby website](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) for more information.
If you are on Linux or macOS, we recommend that you use [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) to manage Ruby installations on your computer.

### Windows

Coming soon.

### macOS

Coming soon.

### Debian-based Linux distributions

1. Install PostgreSQL and libpq-dev if they are not already installed:

   ```bash
   $ sudo apt-get install postgresql libpq-dev
   ```

2. Run the following commands in a PostgreSQL shell to allow MakerRepo to connect:

   ```SQL
   ALTER USER "postgres" WITH PASSWORD 'postgres';
   CREATE DATABASE makerspacerepo;
   ```

3. Clone this repository and go into it:

   ```bash
   $ git clone git@github.com:uOttawa-Makerspace/MakerSpaceRepo
   $ cd MakerSpaceRepo
   ```

4. Install gems:
   ```bash
   $ bundle install
   ```
5. Create X.509 certificates for SAML:
   ```
   $ openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout certs/saml.key -out certs/saml.crt -days 365 -nodes
   ```
6. Set up the database:
   ```bash
   $ rake db:setup
   ```
7. Run all tests to load clean fixtures into the database (fixtures are dummy instances of models for testing and development):

   ```bash
   $ bundle exec rake
   ```

8. Start the Rails server:
   ```bash
   $ rails s
   ```

Happy coding!

## Deployment

Deployment is managed by [Capistrano](https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano). To deploy to production, run the following command:
